# DSHpy
 DSHpy is a python package developed to analyze Dynamic Speckle Holography (DSH) videos as illustrated in: S. Aime, M. Sabato, L. Xiao, and D. Weitz, *Dynamic Speckle Holography*, Phys. Rev. Lett. (2021).
 
 The package takes videos of speckle patterns in the form of Multi-Image files (MIfiles) and computes correlation functions resolved in space and time. 
 In addition, it uses the correlation values to compute displacements and velocity maps.
 
## Usage
 The package comes with tutorials that illustrate how to: (1) work with MIfiles; (2) compute correlation maps; (3) convert the correlation maps into displacements and velocity maps.

 In addition, the package includes one module (SALS) to process small angle light scattering data. One tutorial is dedicated to SALS analysis using this python package.
